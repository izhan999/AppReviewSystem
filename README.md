# ðŸ“± App Review System

This is a basic command-line project I created to practice building backend logic and working with databases. The app lets users register, log in, and manage reviews for different mobile or web apps.

It includes user authentication and full CRUD functionality â€” you can write, edit, and delete your own reviews after logging in.

### ðŸ”§ What I Learned:
- How to handle user input securely
- How to design and set up a relational database using SQL
- Writing Python scripts that interact with the database
- Structuring a real-world project from scratch

---

### ðŸ’» How to Run:
1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP
2. Make sure Python 3 is installed
3. Open terminal in the project folder and run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The app auto-creates the SQLite database the first time you run it.

### ðŸ“Š Tech Stack:
- Python (CLI-based)
- SQLite (built-in Python DB)

---

### ðŸ“‚ Files Included:
- `app.py` â€“ The main logic for user login and review system
- `database.sql` â€“ Schema for users and reviews
- `sample_data.sql` â€“ Optional test data
- `screenshots/` â€“ Contains a console screenshot
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Dependencies list

### ðŸ’¬ Why I Made This:
I wanted to build something small but practical that would let me apply what I learned about databases, authentication, and clean code in Python. This project helped me understand how to manage user accounts and store information persistently using SQLite.
